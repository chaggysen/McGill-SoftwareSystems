## Assignment 2:
backup.sh will take an individual file or directory, and back it up into a tar file. Specifically, this script takes two inputs:
1. The directory where the tar file should be saved. 
2. An individual file or directory to backup. 
Furthermore, the name of the tar file created will need to contain the name of the directory or file (without the extension) and the date the backup was created in YYYYMMDD format. Finally, the script will need to returnwith error code 0 upon success and the appropriate error code otherwise.
